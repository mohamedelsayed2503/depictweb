```

## Security Headers Verification

After deployment, verify these headers are present:

```bash
# Test security headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Should include:
# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Content-Security-Policy: ...
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Events to Monitor
1. **Rate Limit Violations**
   - Multiple requests from same IP
   - Unusual traffic patterns

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Failed login attempts
   - Invalid tokens

3. **Suspicious Activities**
   - Access to admin paths
   - Malformed requests
   - SQL injection attempts

4. **System Health**
   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

### Recommended Monitoring Tools
- **Application Monitoring**: Sentry, LogRocket
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: DataDog, New Relic
- **Security Monitoring**: Cloudflare Security, AWS WAF
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom, UptimeRobot

## Incident Response Plan

### 1. Security Incident Detection
- Monitor security logs continuously
- Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security audits

### 2. Immediate Response
1. **Assess the threat level**
2. **Isolate affected systems** if necessary
3. **Document the incident**
4. **Notify stakeholders**

### 3. Investigation
1. **Analyze logs** to understand the attack vector
2. **Identify compromised data** or systems
3. **Determine the scope** of the incident

### 4. Recovery
1. **Patch vulnerabilities** that were exploited
2. **Restore systems** from clean backups if needed
3. **Update security measures**
4. **Monitor for continued threats**

### 5. Post-Incident
1. **Conduct post-mortem** analysis
2. **Update security procedures**
3. **Train team** on lessons learned
4. **Improve monitoring** and detection

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Monitor error rates

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Security audit of code changes
